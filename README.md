# MARIN2 Virtual Reality Toolkit (MARIN2VRTK)

Included prefabs and scripts for:

* Curved teleportation tools
* Gamepad-based movement tools
* Scripts for creating tooltips and interactable VR menus using Unity UI tools
* Gaze pointer (reticle)
* Teleport marker

Created in Unity 5.4.0f3 (64-bit). Open the project in Unity, and see the "examples"-scene for tips on how to use the features. The gamepad-based tools were designed for Xbox One and 360 controllers, while rest of the scripts should be platform-independent. Minor changes to the code need to be made to get the scripts working with e.g. HTC Vive/SteamVR.
